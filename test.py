test.py

This module contains test cases designed to validate the functionality of the 
application using the pytest framework. It includes both positive and negative 
tests for key functions and ensures the code behaves as expected under different 
input scenarios.

The test cases include:
- Testing valid inputs to verify correct output.
- Handling invalid inputs to ensure the proper exceptions are raised.
- Verifying edge cases to strengthen the robustness of the application.

These tests are intended to be run as part of a Continuous Integration/Continuous 
Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure code quality and reliability.
